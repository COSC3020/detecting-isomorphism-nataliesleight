# Graph Isomorphism

Devise an algorithm to determine whether two given graphs are isomorphic or not.
It takes two graphs as an argument and returns `true` or `false`, depending on
whether the graphs are isomorphic or not. Your algorithm needs to handle both
the case where the two graphs are isomorphic and where they are not isomorphic.

Hint: Your algorithm does not need to be the best possible algorithm, but should
avoid unnecessarily repeating work.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ time complexity of your algorithm?

I used this site to learn about methods to detect isomorphism and how that may look in code: https://tonicanada.medium.com/brute-force-code-for-isomorphisms-1241ef180570

I used chatgpt to figure out which method was best for what I needed and how some of that may look in javascript. My functions have segments of code from what was provided. I used this prompt: "what is the best method to test isomorphism between two graphs in coding, javascript specifically"

I used this site to look into some JavaScript methods and operators: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax
